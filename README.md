##  Random Number Generators

#### Tausworthe Generators 
Tausworthe Generator (TG) is a kind of multiplicative recursive generator which produces random bits. It has the following form:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=x_{n&plus;1}&space;=&space;(A_{1}x_{n}&space;&plus;&space;A_{2}x_{n-1}&space;&plus;&space;\cdots&space;&plus;&space;A_{k}x_{n-k&plus;1})\mod{2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_{n&plus;1}&space;=&space;(A_{1}x_{n}&space;&plus;&space;A_{2}x_{n-1}&space;&plus;&space;\cdots&space;&plus;&space;A_{k}x_{n-k&plus;1})\mod{2}" title="x_{n+1} = (A_{1}x_{n} + A_{2}x_{n-1} + \cdots + A_{k}x_{n-k+1})\mod{2}" /></a>

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;x_{i},&space;A_{i}\in&space;\left&space;\{&space;0,1&space;\right&space;\}\hspace{0.2cm}\forall&space;i" title="x_{i}, A_{i}\in \left \{ 0,1 \right \}\hspace{0.2cm}\forall i" />

The theory behind TG is related to irreducible primitive polynomials over GF(2). A polynomial over Galois field of order 2 (GF(2)) is a polynomial whose coefficients are either 0 and 1. Such a polynomial is irreducible primitive if it does not have nontrivial factors like 1 and has order of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;2^{n}-1" title="2^{n}-1" /> for some <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;n" title="n" />. The order of a polynomial <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;f(x)" title="f(x)" /> over GF(2) is the smallest integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;e" title="e" />  for which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;f(x)" title="f(x)" /> divides <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;x^{e}-1" title="x^{e}-1" />. For example <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;x^{2}&plus;x&plus;1" title="x^{2}+x+1" />  is irreducible primitive with order <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;3&space;=&space;2^2&space;-&space;1" title="3 = 2^2 - 1" />, while <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;x^2&plus;1=\left&space;(&space;x&plus;1&space;\right&space;)^2" title="x^2+1=\left ( x+1 \right )^2" /> is not even irreducible.

When the characteristic polynomial of the above form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;P\left&space;(&space;z&space;\right&space;)&space;=&space;z^{k}&space;-&space;A_{1}z^{k-1}&space;-&space;\cdots&space;-&space;A_{k}" title="P\left ( z \right ) = z^{k} - A_{1}z^{k-1} - \cdots - A_{k}" /> s an irreducible primitive and the $k$ initial seeds are not all zero, the corresponding TG will have a period of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;2^{k}-1" title="2^{k}-1" /> . To obtain random numbers instead of bits, we can output the decimal values of every <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;k" title="k" />-consecutive bits. 

Since TG only produces bits, it is too slow to be useful. A technique to speed up is to use a special form called trinomial-based TG. A trinomial is a polynomial with only three coefficients being nonzero, so a trinomial-based TG has only two of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;A_{i}" title="A_{i}" /> coefficients of the characteristic polynomial being nonzero. This results in a very fast, hardware-based implementation technique called Feedback Shift Register (FSR) which involves shift, AND, and XOR operations on a small set of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;k" title="k" />-bits registers. However, TGs based on this special form are known to have statistical defects, so in practice the outputs of two or more trinomial-based TGs are combined using bitwise XOR operations to provide the final output. As with LCGs, arbitrarily chosen parameters will yield poor TGs, and not all combinations of any three good TGs necessarily create a better TG, therefore, in this project we implemented a 3-combined TG based on parameters from [11] with period <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;2^{88}" title="2^{88}" />
